# Project Overview

**Two Portals - A Gemstone Puzzle Game** is a grid-based movement puzzle game developed for the Steam platform (by Stubbird Games). The game challenges the player to manipulate gemstones, activate locks, and connect passages via portals to reach the final objective.

## Development and Technical Focus

As the **main (solo) developer** for the project, I was responsible for the complete development cycle, from mechanic conception to the implementation of all 60 levels.

### Key Technical Contributions:

* **Grid Movement System:**
    * Implemented a movement and collision system restricted to the grid (2D Tilemap/Grid), ensuring that every step and map interaction was predictable and crucial for the puzzle solution.
* **Portal Mechanics:**
    * Created a robust system of portal pairs that allows the player to cross the scenario and link sections of the grid, serving as the central mechanic for solving the puzzle.
* **Custom Level Editor:**
    * Developed in-engine tools (**Custom Editor** in Unity) to quickly design and configure the game's 60 levels, controlling the position of gemstones, locks, and portals. This significantly streamlined the Level Design phase.
* **Puzzle Logic:**
    * Implemented the conditional activation logic, where the player must collect/move gemstones to open locks, activate passages, and disable hazards in the correct sequence.
* **PC Optimization:**
    * Focused on performance optimization and the correct integration with basic Steam features.

This game exemplifies my ability to deliver a complete puzzle title, featuring well-defined mechanics and a large volume of content (60 levels).
