# Project Overview

**Lendas do Pebol: Mythic Football** is an arcade sports title released on Steam. The game combines the excitement of 1v1 football with rich Amazonian mythology, where players control legends like the Boto and the Boitat√°.

## My Contribution and Challenges

The project was developed by Sardinha Studios, and my responsibilities focused on ensuring the gameplay experience and user infrastructure:

* **Ability Mechanics:** Implementation of the unique special abilities for each legend, adding a tactical element to the match.
* **Game Modes:** Development of the Story Mode (to learn about the legends), Quick Match, a progressive difficulty Tournament Mode, and Versus Match (local multiplayer).
* **Steam Integration:** Optimization for Steam features, including support for **Remote Play Together** for online matches and the future implementation of *Achievements*.
* **Optimization:** Focusing on optimization to ensure that scenarios based on Amazonian cities run smoothly.

## Key Features

* **Local PvP Mode:** Support for 1 keyboard and 1 controller, or Remote Play Together via Steam.
* **Stylized 3D Graphics:** Cartoon-style art to bring the legends to life.
