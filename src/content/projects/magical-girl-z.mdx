# Project Overview

**Magical Girl Z** is an ambitious project that challenges the player to control two *Magical Girls* simultaneously (Love and Rage) using the two joysticks of a controller. The goal is to stop an advancing zombie horde and protect civilians.

## Systems Design and Implementation

This project was an excellent study in control and character synergy *game design*:

* **Dual Control System:** The biggest technical challenge was the mapped *input*: *Magical Girl Love* (left side) builds defense towers using energy. *Magical Girl Rage* (right side) obliterates zombies with fury rays and **steals energy** for Love.
* **Synergy Logic:** The game demands strict cooperation between the two halves of the brain (and the controller!). If one character dies, or a civilian is harmed, it's game over.
* **Horde AI:** Development of a zombie horde AI system that moves towards targets (characters or civilians) and interacts with defense towers.

## Learnings

The project highlighted the complexity of designing and implementing an unconventional control system that, despite being challenging, offers a unique *gameplay* experience.
