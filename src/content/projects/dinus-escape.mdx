# Project Overview

**Dinus Escape** is an exciting precision *2D platformer*, where the player controls the dinosaur Dinus in a race against time. The world is about to be hit by a meteor, and Dinus has only **10 seconds** per level to collect meat and hide.

## Contribution to Game Design and Development

The focus of this project is on creating an intense and engaging challenge:

* **Level Design (50 Levels):** Construction of 50 levels with unique challenges and obstacles, requiring high movement precision.
* **Time Mechanic (10s):** The strict implementation of the 10-second limit adds a layer of urgency, being the central element of the gameplay.
* **Graphics and Art:** Classic *cartoon* visual style, ensuring a charming and nostalgic look.
* **2D Physics:** Fine-tuning of character physics to make movements responsive and satisfying.
