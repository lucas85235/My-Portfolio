## **Summary**
Warbots is a competitive, real-time card game prototype where each player builds a modular robot that determines their deck and playstyle. The version delivered at Gamejam+ 2022 proved the core loop (construction, rapid card selection, and simultaneous resolution), validating the competitive potential and appeal for quick, tense matches.

## **Technical Systems & My Role**

In this project, I acted as the **primary programmer and prototypist** for the central mechanics. My key focus was building the competitive core loop while ensuring design flexibility.

* **Core Systems Implementation (C# / ScriptableObjects):**
    * Coded the **Modular Robot Construction** (5-slot system) which drives the **Automatic Deck Generation** (~20 cards) and determines in-game synergies.
    * Implemented the **Short Turn Loop** (20s card selection) and the **Deterministic Resolution** logic, ensuring consistent outcomes for simultaneous actions.
    * Used **ScriptableObjects** extensively for all card and part data to simplify balancing and allow for *hot-reloads*.
* **Prototyping & Iteration Quality:**
    * Developed **Editor Tools** (*inspector helpers*, simple importers) to empower designers to adjust parameters without requiring recompilation.
    * Conducted rapid **Playtest Cycles** (collecting basic metrics) and learned that small changes in costs/time profoundly impact player decisions.
    * Prioritized **simple, reliable solutions** (e.g., using a *simple authoritative server* for the prototype) to validate concepts quickly, even when it meant sacrificing advanced features like high latency tolerance.

## Network and Multiplayer Architecture

The game used a **Simple Authoritative Architecture** to ensure the integrity of simultaneous turns.

* **Message Flow:** The process is based on a **logical tick per turn** (not continuous). The server resolves actions deterministically (in a fixed order) after receiving the client's choices.
* **Communication:** **Serialization** uses a simple binary format for *snapshots* and *diffs*. **Transport** used TCP/HTTP in the prototype, but **UDP** is recommended for production to reduce latency in real-time games.
* **Limitations and Learnings:**
    * A simple authoritative architecture exposes players to *delays*.
    * The prototype was not prepared for many simultaneous games (*scalability*) nor for *failover*/replication.
    * Security is limited to *sanity checks*; a final product requires more robust validations and anti-cheat measures.
