## **Summary & Core Gameplay**
Warbots is a competitive, real-time card game prototype where each player assembles a modular robot that determines their deck and playstyle. The version delivered at Gamejam+ 2022 proved the **core loop** (construction, rapid card selection, and simultaneous resolution), validating its competitive potential and appeal for fast, tense matches.

## Technical Implementation & My Role

In this project, I acted as the **primary programmer and prototypist** for the central mechanics.

* **Core Systems:**
    * I implemented the **Modular Robot Construction** (5-slot system) which drives the **Dynamic Deck Generation** (~20 cards) and the **Short Turn Loop** (20s selection window).
    * Coded the **Deterministic Resolution** logic for consistent outcomes in simultaneous actions.
* **Tools and Iteration:**
    * Developed **Editor Tools** (*inspector helpers*, *templates*) using **ScriptableObjects** to allow designers to adjust cards/parts without recompilation.
    * Conducted rapid *playtest* cycles and parameter adjustments, learning that small changes in costs/time profoundly impact player decisions.
* **Prototyping Quality:** I prioritized **simple and reliable solutions** for quick validation. For example, I used an authoritative server with deterministic resolution to prevent *desyncs* in the prototype.

## Network Architecture and Multiplayer

The game's rapid, simultaneous turns required a network structure to ensure integrity.

* **Message Flow:** The game used a **Simple Authoritative Architecture**. The process is based on a **logical tick per turn** (not continuous). The server resolves actions **deterministically** (fixed order) after receiving client choices.
* **Communication:** **Serialization** used a simple binary format for *snapshots* and *diffs*. **Transport** used TCP/HTTP in the prototype, but **UDP** is recommended for production to reduce latency in real-time games.
* **Limitations and Learnings:**
    * The simple authoritative architecture exposes players to *delays*.
    * The prototype was not prepared for many simultaneous matches (*scalability*) or for *failover*/replication.
    * Security was limited to *sanity checks*; a final product requires more robust validations and **anti-cheat** measures.
