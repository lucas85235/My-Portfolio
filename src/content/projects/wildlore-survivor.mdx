# Project Overview

**Wildlore Survivors** was developed as a **prototype** focused on combining addictive *survival* action with the rich and underexplored mythology of the Amazon Rainforest.

The game aims to immerse the player in a magical world where nature and adventure are shaped by Tupi-Guarani legends.

## Key Gameplay Features

The gameplay is built around quick challenges and high replayability:

* **Immersive Narrative:** You play as **Yari**, the young shaman, embarking on a journey to discover the rich forest mythology.
* **Three Playable Heroes:** The main cast includes Yari, the Chief Kaimi, and the Adventurer Maya, each with unique skills for the adventure.
* **Mythological Monsters:** Confront and discover the secrets of legendary creatures, such as the Teju Jagua, Mboi Tu'i, and Kurupi.
* **Randomized Skill Selection:** The progression system is inspired by roguelikes, where adventure, defeating enemies, and leveling up grant random weapons and abilities, making each playthrough unique.

## Contribution and Technical Focus

My main focus on this project was:

1.  **Systems Design:** Creating the core gameplay loop that balances *survival* difficulty with *roguelike* progression.
2.  **Skill Implementation:** Utilizing **Unity and C#**, I implemented the system for selecting and upgrading passive and active skills, ensuring that the synergies between heroes and abilities were satisfying.
3.  **Artistic Integration:** I worked closely with the art team to ensure that the Amazon Rainforest pixel art assets and the mythological monster designs were faithfully represented in the game engine.
