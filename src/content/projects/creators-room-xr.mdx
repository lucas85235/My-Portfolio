# Project Overview

**Creators Room** is an **Extended Reality (XR/AR)** project developed within the Sidia Institute of Science and Technology. It functions as a **virtual environment focused on content creators** who wish to use avatars to record various types of videos and interact in digital spaces.

The project's visual style is more **cartoony** and stylized. Although the avatars have a more adult look, the focus of the *asset pipeline* is on the charm and expressiveness of the cartoon, rather than attempting to be extremely realistic.

## Technical Focus and My Contribution

As a **SW Developer & Technical Artist** at Sidia, my contributions focused on translating this stylized artistic direction into a high-performance XR environment.

### Key Technical Contributions:

* **Stylized Asset Optimization:** Responsible for ensuring that cartoon-style avatar models and scenarios were optimized to run fluidly on XR *headsets* with performance constraints.
* **Art Pipeline and Custom Shaders:** Role as a Technical Artist in the validation, integration, and creation of *shaders* that enhanced the cartoony visual (e.g., *Cel Shading* or *Toon Shading*) while maintaining performance.
* **Avatar and Animation Implementation:** Development of the avatar manipulation and control system, including *IK* (Inverse Kinematics) logic and real-time movement synchronization.
* **Content Tool Logic:** Prototyping and implementation of the virtual tools that content creators use within the environment for recording their videos.

This project demonstrates my experience in combining stylized art and cutting-edge technical development, crucial for Extended Reality projects focused on avatars and social content.
