# Project Overview

**Nação Pebol** is a sports project developed using **Unity**. The game was created for **GameJam+ 2020** in the **#FlaSports** category.

The goal was to create a unique *hypercasual* football experience, focused on a journey with Flamengo idols in search of victory.

My responsibilities included:

* **Simplified Mechanics:** Creating intuitive and fast football gameplay, characteristic of the *hypercasual* genre.

## Technologies Used

The use of Unity allowed for quick porting to various platforms:

* **Unity:** Core game development.
* **C#:** Game logic and mechanics.
