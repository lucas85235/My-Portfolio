# Project Overview

**Space Ship Infinity** is an arcade *shoot 'em up* reminiscent of the classics from the 80s. The game is an infinite survival *bullet hell*, where the player must aim for the highest score by collecting coins to unlock and upgrade *power-ups* and ship statistics.

## Technical Aspects

The focus is on describing your contribution to the system development:

* **Upgrade Systems:** Development of the logic for the coin system and the application of permanent upgrades to the ship's speed, health, and damage.
* **Power-Ups:** Implementation of initial *power-ups* like Triple Shot, Double Points, and Healer, and the management of their *cooldown* and duration.
* **Arcade Gameplay:** Focus on creating simple and responsive controls (keyboard and mouse) for the fast *arcade* style.
* **Localization:** Support for translation into various languages (Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, and Russian).

## Impact

The project is an excellent example of how to create a *score-chasing* experience.
