# Project Overview

**WTF - Wheels Tires Flesh** is an intense *arcade* action project, focused on high scoring (*score-chasing*). The game explores a horror and *gore* theme, where the player drives a vehicle to run over and destroy hordes of grotesque monsters.

## Mechanics and Design

The core design focuses on a simple yet addictive mechanic: surviving the highest number of waves possible while managing resources and upgrades.

* **Focus on Physics and Collision:** A major technical challenge was creating a satisfying 2D physics system for the vehicle, ensuring that collisions with enemies (and the subsequent *gore*) were impactful and responsive.
* **Optimization:** Given the amount of objects and particles on screen (monsters, blood, pieces of flesh), optimizing the particle system and rendering was crucial to maintaining a fluid frame rate.
* **Progression and Difficulty:** The difficulty design is dynamic, increasing enemy density and introducing new monster types as the player's score grows.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to implement fast action experiences focused on *game feel*, with special attention to visual and physics elements that create an intense and captivating experience.
