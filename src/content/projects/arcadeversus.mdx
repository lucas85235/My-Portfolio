# Project Overview

**Arcadeversus** is a project developed to be played directly in the browser (*Play in browser*), which requires a focus on web optimization and accessibility.

## Focus on Accessibility

The main goal of this project was to ensure that the **arcade** experience was instantly accessible, without the need for downloads:

* **WebGL Optimization:** Ensuring that the HTML5 build (WebGL, if made in Unity) was lightweight and loaded quickly across various browsers.
* **Universal Controls:** Configuration of controls that work perfectly on both *desktop* (mouse/keyboard) and touchscreen (if applicable).
* **Minimalist Scope:** Maintaining the scope focused on simple *arcade* mechanics to allow for immediate gameplay.

## Technologies

The "Play in browser" nature suggests a web *build* technology:

* **Engine:** Unity or similar.
* **Language:** C# or similar.
* **Build:** HTML5.
